# Aero

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bbridges/aero.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bbridges/aero)

Aero is an experimental programming language aimed to have a statically-typed
Actor model implementation similar to Erlang and the semantics more-or-less of
an ML.

*Programming language* is a strong term. It's currently nowhere near that.
Hopefully, this changes in the future!
