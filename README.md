# Aero

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bbridges/aero.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bbridges/aero)

Aero is an experimental programming language aimed to be statically typed,
purely functional with uniqueness types and eager evaluation, and oriented
entirely around the actor model: a blend of the ideas of Erlang, Elixir, Rust,
and Clean.

Currently the language is being bootstrapped with an Erlang-based compiler
targeting Core Erlang for a future self-hosting compiler. Lots of work remains
before the language is in any sort of usable state.
